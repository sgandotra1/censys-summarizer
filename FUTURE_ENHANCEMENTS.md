# Future Enhancements â€“ Censys Host Summarizer

If given more time to work on this project, I would focus on the following improvements:

## AI Enhancements
- Experiment with different prompt styles and track which ones improve accuracy.  
- Add context-aware analysis (e.g., treating web servers, databases, and IoT devices differently).  
- Implement confidence scoring so users know when outputs may be unreliable.  
- Explore integrating live threat intelligence feeds to keep results current.  

## Backend & Architecture
- Add a PostgreSQL database to store analysis history and trends.  
- Break the backend into smaller services for easier scaling and maintenance.  
- Introduce a queue/worker system to support parallel analysis.  

## Security & Compliance
- Enable end-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest.  
- Implement role-based access control for different user types.  
- Begin aligning the system with SOC 2 and GDPR requirements.  

## User Experience
- Build a real-time dashboard for monitoring analysis progress and results.  
- Add visualizations such as risk heat maps or service graphs.  
- Provide export options (PDF, CSV) and collaboration features like comments.  
- Create guided onboarding and in-app help to make the tool easier to use.  

## Integrations
- Add basic integrations with Slack/Teams for notifications and Jira/ServiceNow for ticketing.  
- Expand to SIEM tools (e.g., Splunk, QRadar) and vulnerability scanners like Nessus.  
- Support cloud provider APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP) for direct analysis of cloud environments.

With more development time, these enhancements would help move the project from a proof-of-concept into a scalable and practical security analysis platform.
